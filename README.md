# Demonstration of a Simple SwiftUI Project
- This project builds a **full-stack** to-do list app--although there is no cloud storage--that allows you to view your tasks and manage them by adding or removing. 
- It covers some very **important** concepts ranging from **frontend (views)** to **state management**. 
- The goal for you is to understand **every line of code** in this project. More specifically, you should be able to tell what each line does and how the state transitions to the next one. After that, you should be able to **recreate** the **entire codebase** from scratch based on the project description from the frist bullet point.
- And with that you should be confident enough to be part of the team contributing to ARchitect implementation.

# Installation Guide
- You can either download this directly and open in Xcode or clone this repo to your local device.
